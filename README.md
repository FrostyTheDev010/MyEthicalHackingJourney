# MyEthicalHackingJourney
My journal about my Ethical Hacking and Pentesting Journey
hello, its currently 10:31 PM 2/26/2025 while im writing this, i made this repository to journalise and take you guys with me on this hacking journey wherre ill learn many things, currently, i have zero experience, but hopefully i will turn from zero to hero with time.
for learning today, im using TryHackMe
today i learned about gobuster, i think its a command-line application, which means a program with no GUI avec whom we interact with text and "commands", im really really familiar with command-line applications since i made many in my programming carrer, mostly cuz im lazy to make the gui (it gives more of a hacking vibe like this).
so this gobuster thingy is downloadable from github and what it does is just search for / thingys that can complete a website so we can find hidden unacsessible pages to the normal people and exploit them, on try hack me, i used this command "gobuster -u http://fakebank.thm -w wordlist.txt dir" to find 2 hidden websites with /images and /bank-transfer after the fakebank's adress; http://fakebank.thm , so now, the -u in the command (which i think stands for URL) specifies the website, like we did, after that, the -w specifies the wordlist to use, which i think is a texte file with many many / thingys, what gobuster does as of now for me is test all of the different / in the wordlist to find a working one, thats all for now.
just finished my first room, Offensive Security Intro, now getting into Defensive Security Intro. I'm 2% into Pre Security, hooray! it may seem a teeny tiny bit but at least its some progress, nothing starts easy, as of difficulty, i have a feeling cybersecurity has a bit of an easy learning curve, maybe my opinion will change, i dont know.
